## Project Overview

Language Patterns is a small, generative project that shows the intrinsic link between language and data. It was designed for the 2025 University of Mount Union Faculty Show. Through it, I wanted to demonstrate to students how we might look beyond pursuing static, refined outputs, and instead turn our attention to thinking about systems and structures. When we do, we're able to build artifacts and tools capable of handling more than a single message. If our framework of observation shifts to stocks and flows within a system, we can observe inputs and outputs, and focus our experimentation on the spaces between where information is transformed and encoded.

This project was built using the [p5.js library.](https://p5js.org/) [You can find its Github repository here.](https://github.com/nmuffet/language-patterns)
