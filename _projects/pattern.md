[Part of a Pattern](https://nmuffet.github.io/ISTD/){: .link-on-white} is a response to the 2022 ISTD Student Assessmentâ€”an international assessment devoted to typographic excellence with a 30% pass rate. Through this project, I was awarded admission to the International Society of Typographic Designers.
