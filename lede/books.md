The number of biographies that occupy The New York Times Best Sellers list far outweighs any other nonfiction genre. The list, a measure of combined print and ebook sales over the previous week, has long been a barometer for the collective taste of American readers.

It's true that media consumption habits have changed as new options have emerged, (only 75% of Americans read a book at least once a year according to a [2022 Pew survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/01/06/three-in-ten-americans-now-read-e-books/)), but a vast amount of human knowledge is still stored in books. Why then, are so many popular nonfiction books devoted to the lives of other people?

Publishers may use the public interest in celebrities as an excuse to produce content. If the reason for the biographyâ€™s dominance were the sheer volume of books in the genre, it would be expected that The New York Times list would match the distribution of categories published within all of nonfiction. While I was unable to source data for all nonfiction books, I compared the list against a database of over 46,000 books with reviews on [Goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com).

The data shows that the distribution of biographies on The New York Times list is still abnormally high. This trend is also visible when looking at the list on a weekly basis.

For comparison, these charts show the second most popular category, history.
