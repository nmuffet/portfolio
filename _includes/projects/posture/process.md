<p>After a co-design session focusing on release goals and another to determine a stylistic direction, explorations were done to find a visual language that was broad enough to allow for flexibility across mediums but specific enough to create a campaign image. The artist's moodboards, references, and ongoing conversations drove the design process.</p>
