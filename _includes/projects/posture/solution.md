<h3 class="fw4 f4 f3-ns i mb2 mb4-ns mt4 mt5-ns">Concept</h3>

<p class="">In several co-design sessions with the artist, an identity and vision was established for the campaign. The artist wanted the album to have general appeal, but its content and messaging were best-aligned with aspects of irony, performance art, anti-design, and neo-brutalism. The challenge this framed was to create pieces that were both visually appealing but intentionally abrasive or challenging.</p>

<p>As content for the campaign, I created album liner notes, mockups, single art, music videos, lyric videos, Spotify Canvas animations, and motion posters. Later, I designed album art for the <span class="i">St. Isidore demos</span> release. <a class="link link-on-white underline near-black hover-bg-gold pv2" href="https://www.nykimakes.com/design" target="_blank"> Original album artwork and vinyl layout was designed by Nyki Fetterman.</a></p>
