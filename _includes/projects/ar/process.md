<p>
I designed this research process to scale by making the collection process totally automated once the QR code on the poster is scanned. The workflow goes something like this:
View print poster → Scan QR code → Submit email → Receive Instagram filter link → Receive short-term info recall survey 3 minutes later → Receive long-term information recall survey 7 days later
</p>


<p>Running on the free Google Forms survey platform, responses are collected in a Google Sheet for easy analysis. To automate the research process, I learned to code a script that checks for new responses and emails them the short-term survey immediately after viewing and the long-term survey seven days later.</p>

<p>Next, this process was continued leaving objective content in both versions of the a poster but using 3D and frame-breaking augmentation as a differentiating factor. My studies showed that this received a much more intriguing and positive reaction from  viewers, but as soon as the augmentation is triggered, viewers stop reading the content.</p>
<p>
This tells us two things.
</p><ol>
<li>Breaking the frame of reference is important for eliciting a response of audience immersion.</li>
<li>Where an augmentation is triggered in the viewer journey is critical because, without guidance, it essentially closes the gate to material presented outside of the augmentation.</li>
</ol>
