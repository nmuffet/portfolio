## Brief
#### Objective
In 2023, Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute's Communications team set out to create a report that highlighted the breadth and impact of its work and outcomes over the course of the year. I was fortunate to partner with the team again in 2024, during which we produced a toolkit of presentation slides for various internal audiences as well as a high-level one-sheet for executives.

#### Audience
Internal caregivers were the primary audience, but the report needed to be flexible enough to work for external or community stakeholder presentations.

#### Constraints
The primary intent was to be digital, but the team needed a report that was flexible enough to function across mediums, whether print, digital static document, or in-person presentation.
