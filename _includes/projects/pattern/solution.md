<h3 class="fw4 f4 f3-ns i mt5">Concept</h3>




<p class="mt2 mt4-ns">Part of a Pattern is an experiential website that explores SDG 10 Reduced Inequality and SDG 13 Climate Action through systems thinking. It seeks to shift paradigm thinking about how these complex problems are discussed rather than attempting to provide clear-cut solutions. Framed in this way, solution goals were narrowed to:
</p><ul class="pl0">
<li>Introduce the audience to systems thinking through SDG goals</li>
<li class="mt2">Provoke thought on the role of individuals as atoms of systems</li>
</ul>
<p>By acknowledging complexity and providing a framework to begin addressing it, the site attempts to move the dialogue on climate action at an individual level away from typical refrains such as recycling, using less water, and avoiding meat.

<p class="">
The webpage itself is made up of randomized modules from a set graphic language. Every time the site is refreshed, a different version is delivered. Even though each page view is unique, the content, structure, and message remain the same. This pulls the concept of the project through to its execution at a macro scale and speaks to the difference between the individual unit and the system itself.</p>

<h3 class="fw4 f4 f3-ns i mt4 mt5-ns">Experience</h3>
<p>At a lower level, the webpage features interactive elements and animating modules and letterforms within text. This continues to demonstrate the differences between individual nodes and larger systems through abstraction. Without directly stating it, it questions how many elements must change before the system as a whole becomes something new.</p>

<p>The use of abstraction and experience provide the visitor with room to exercise creative and divergent thinking. Prompting thought with questions rather than speaking at an audience avoids automatic responses and can promote self-discovery of concepts and a stronger connection.</p>
