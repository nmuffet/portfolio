<p>After researching the SDG goals, broad studies on inequality, and the largest barriers to climate action, it was determined that this project would seek to address the goals in a broad and abstract way rather than try to pinpoint one small problem and address it fully.  This widened the audience to a point where easy access to the information became a chief concern, making digital a cost-effective solution.</p>
<p> Systems thinking is a common thread that comes up when researching any complex societal problem. Digging into these texts revealed common metaphors of nodes, atoms, cells to demonstrate the structure of a large network. This became a primary focus for exploration

<p>Because the solution would be digital, interactive and animated explorations were also conducted.</p>

<p>Many of these did not incorporate the metaphor of the letter as an individual unit in typography very well, leading to text replacement and tracking effects.</p>

<p>The coding needed to execute these experiments was learned as I went along and has opened up a new avenue for thinking about design solutions.</p>
<p>These experiments created interesting ways to think about the solution, but an overall structure and narrative still needed to be established. Layouts and typefaces were explored with a focus on modularity.</p>

<p>Turning to the most basic forms in design both simplified and abstracted the solution in a way that worked well. With the final design language in place, an algorithm to dynamically generate the page was created and the final layout could be designed.</p>
