<p>Ideation began by considering single words that could be used as overarching themes and then writing a rough
    description that justifies them. It was important that they be topical enough to capture the present moment
    but not so obvious or specific that they distract from the actual content of the conference, which was yet
    to be determined.</p>
<p>The written word was a useful initial exploration because it allowed the generation of a framework for
    evaluating typographic solutions. The words and adjectives used to describe the concept could be used to vet
    typefaces and forms moving forward.
    Three initial options were chosen including:
</p>

<div class="measure-wide">
<div class="pull ml4 bl b--white-40 f5 i pl4 mv4">
    <p>Morph</p>
    <p> We exist in a period of accelerated change that often relies on evolution and transformation rather than 1 for 1 replacement of ideas and norms, resulting in something different rather than completely new.</p>

    <p>Transformation | Shapeshifting | Mutation | Melting | Growing | Organic
    </p>
</div>

<div class="pull ml4 bl b--white-40 f5 i pl4 mv4">
    <p>Xtend</p>
    <p> XR will give motion design exponential extension into everyday design problems and real-world
        interactions. How can motion design education provide the necessary skills and extend application of its tools to meet these new opportunities?</p>
        <p>  Expansion | Depth | Tracking | Extension of forms | Extrusion | Dimension</p>

    <p></p>
</div>

<div class="pull ml4 bl b--white-40 f5 i pl4 mv4">
    <p>Unframed</p>
    <p> There is a growing societal emphasis on needing to understand context. This also references the way design students are taught to tackle complex problems and motion design as a practice that relies on frames.</p>
    <p>Deconstruction | Line &amp; Plane | Framing | Overlap | Panning</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Interestingly, even though the final solution retained the Unframed concept, ideas and explorations from each initial idea made their way into various artifacts.</p>

<p>After concepts were written out, sketches were made to explore possible visual directions for each one.</p>

<p>Refinement of the concepts was continued with type studies. A key deliverable of this project was a programme mock for the entire conference, meaning the typefaces would need significant range for a deep hierarchy.</p>

<p>Type explorations naturally flowed into layout and mark explorations. Shapes and accent elements were created by deconstructing the chosen headline faceâ€”Calvino Monoline Italic. The deconstructed typeface served as the basis assuming that if forms were derived from the type, everything would inherit and internal logic naturally.</p>

<p>When the initial proposal was finalized and the pitch was selected by the MODE committee, I worked with them to produce color studies and smaller versions of the logo for the final piece.</p>
