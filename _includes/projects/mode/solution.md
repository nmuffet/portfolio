### Concept
MODE '23: Unframed recognizes the concept of framing in all forms of design education, including motion. Context and framing have become especially important topics outside of the classroom as our society grapples with complex and unframed problems.
<div class='img-container'><img src="/assets/images/mode/environment.jpg">
<figcaption>Environmental signage using the identity.</figcaption> </div>

Unframed asks design educators to give their students not only the confidence to look at problems in context but to unframe and reframe them — using frameworks and theories as tools rather than restrictions.

Such a broad concept allows the identity to be flexible enough to house speakers and workshops on any topic.


{% include img.html
    src="/assets/images/mode/programmeMock.jpg"
    alt="Program mock flat"
    aspect-ratio='16x9'
    class="mode-program"
    caption="The conference program was a key deliverable for this identity."
%}



{% include img.html
    src="/assets/images/mode/nametag.jpg"
    alt="Nametag"
    caption="The elements of shape and line are flexible enough for any application."
%}


### Mark System

<div class="flex mv2 mv4-ns justify-around ">
        <img class="w-25" src="/assets/images/mode/logo2.svg" alt="MODE Unframed logo 2">
        <img class="w-20" src="/assets/images/mode/logo3.svg" alt="MODE Unframed logo 3">
        <img class="w-20" src="/assets/images/mode/logo4.svg" alt="MODE Unframed logo 2">

    </div>

The Unframed concept lends itself to a mark system rather than a single logo. Elements within the system can be reconfigured or invented for an endless variety of visuals for diverse situations that can speak with a singular distinct voice.

The mark system is composed of three elements:

- Background plane
- Accent strokes
- Logotype

### Animation

<div class="mv2 mv4-ns">
            <!--#region Video-->
            <video id="player" playsinline="" controls="" poster="/assets/images/mode/unframedAnimation_Moment.jpg">
                <source src="/assets/images/mode/unframedAnimation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                
    
                    </video>
    
    <!--#endregion-->
    <p class="i light-silver f6 mt1 caption mb0">The mark system was designed with animation in mind.</p>
    </div>

As a motion design society, the identity wouldn’t be complete without lending itself to animation. The mark system was composed to withstand shapeshifting forms that can frame and reframe the logotype.

Other motion elements remain energetic and abstract. Like the mark system, shapes and strokes are derived from the main typeface for the identity.

A backing track of drum cadence links the bright and dynamic energy of the imagery to audio.

### Color Palette

<div class="flex justify-between mw7 mv2 mv4-ns">
            <div class="square deeppurple  "></div>
            <div class="purple  square"></div>
            <div class="lavender square"></div>
            <div class="yellow  square"></div>
            <div class="grey  square"></div>
</div>

Conference organizers wanted the palette for 2023 to reflect the year and location. After presenting a variety of options, the palette was narrowed to feature 2023’s color of the year with with complementary colors acting as supports for darker applications and moments where color needed to inject energy into the design.
