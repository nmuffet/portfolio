## Solution

### Concept

The Sandstones product launch utilized a multichannel marketing approach including video ads, social media, newsletter content, web experience, and sales associate touchpoints to drive awareness and interest. I was responsible for planning and executing each item in this process. Capturing compelling product photography and video content was key to this campaign’s success, as well as revamping the Rock Candy Holds webstore.

### Product Photography
I introduced the practice of capturing 360 photography for all Rock Candy products. This was done to give customers a better assessment of primarily tactile products without being able to touch them. User interviews confirmed that this practice helped customers feel more comfortable when compared to static product shots.

Product photos were worked into a pdf sales sheet that could be sent out by our sales team to start conversations with close customers.

I created a series of three videos to drive awareness of the new holds. The storyboard was planned with the knowledge that footage would need to be gathered on a “run and gun” basis without the luxury of being able to hold up regular operations for the shoot.

Interviews were conducted to give a narrative to the content. Because route setters were the primary audience, the narrative was meant to inspire rather than deliver a hard sell.
