## Brief
#### Objective
In 2024 and 2025, I was approached by the Cleveland Clinic Innovations team to develop multiple microsites and pitch decks to showcase their accomplishments throughout the years.

#### Audience
Audiences varied between the deliverables and included internal and external stakeholders.

#### Constraints
Microsites were required to be designed as single page experiences. Sites also needed to be handed off to the Communications team after development in a format that allowed them to adjust content and replicate the design system in the future. This meant developing within the constraints of platforms they were already using. In 2024, sites were developed within the Hubspot CRM. In 2025, the team worked within the Ceros platform.
